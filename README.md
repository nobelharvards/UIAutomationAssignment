# UIAutomationAssignment
Automation assignment for registering/logging in and buying a blue summer dress at http://automationpractice.com.

To run this on your own machine, change the driver directories at `src/test/java/resources/OpenWebsite.java` to point to your own `chromedriver.exe` and `geckodriver.exe`.

Run by either `cd`ing to the UIAutomationAssignment directory in a terminal then `mvn test`, or importing into an IDE as a Maven project.
