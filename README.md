# UIAutomationAssignment
Automation assignment for registering/logging in and buying a blue summer dress at http://automationpractice.com.

If you want to run this on your own machine, you will have to change the driver directory at src\test\java\resources\OpenWebsite.java to point to your own chromedriver.exe and geckodriver.exe.

Run by either cding to the UIAutomationAssignment directory in a terminal, then "mvn test" or importing into an IDE with Maven.
